# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Description of the project

"TravelTrucks" provides the opportunity to rent campers for travel. Our web application allows users to browse available camper models, read reviews from other users, and book their vehicle online.

Redux Toolkit – for managing application state.
React Router – for navigating between pages.
